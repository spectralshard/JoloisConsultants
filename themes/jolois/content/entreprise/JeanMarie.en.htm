    I am an outgoing and bright geek. (Yes, it exists!) I have spent 20 years in the world of education,
    that’s where my passion for computer technology was born. Since the purchase of my first Mac (a Classic color!)
    in 1992, I have not ceased to deepen my knowledge of Macintosh computers and other Apple products.
    I also became in 2006 the President of the Montreal‘s Mac Club.
