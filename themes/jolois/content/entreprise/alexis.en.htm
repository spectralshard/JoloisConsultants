    Your computer is designed to do thousands of different tasks, but often the simplest one can seem complex.
    Take advantage of my expertise and my talent in popularizing IT concepts specific to Apple, having a trusted
    consultant who knows your needs and the solutions that will meet them. This is what I suggest to you.
