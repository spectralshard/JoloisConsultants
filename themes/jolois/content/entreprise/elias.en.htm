    It is with great pride that I announce my arrival in JOLOIS CONSULTANTS. I become the new partner of Jean-Marie Jolois
    and vice-president of the company. I am a specialist in PC, Android and Windows solutions, in addition to being an expert
    in networking and data storage. So let's say that I also become his alter ego since I perfectly complement his company's service offer.
